# Guess Who project week 5

This week's project was to create a digital version of the classic board game Guess Who.
I have practiced creating objects and arrays and connecting this to the DOM.

I watched the pre-recorded videos, attended the live sessions, read through all the material,
and practiced with the labs before I began building my project. I looked at previous students material
to get inspiration and a better understanding of how to build a game.
I followed the recommended steps 1-6 to make it easier to divide my work.

If I had more time I would play around a little more with sound effects and changing up the characters.
